Dapps are generally expected to have an incentive system revolving around a token. Tokens are often distributed to parties during protocol launch to incentivize participation or investment and ensure the launch is successful.

Practical decentralization ideally dictates a level playing field - this implies that no party can be granted special access or favorable terms. Accordingly, private sales or initial closed participation rounds are a breach of this principle and should be avoided.

Team allocations are another sensitive area. While the team building a protocol should generally be compensated for its work, its inherent position as creators will disrupt the level playing field. Accordingly, team allocations should be minimal and external equivalent contributions encouraged.
