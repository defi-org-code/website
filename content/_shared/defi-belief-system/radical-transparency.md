Practical decentralization dictates a level playing field - this requires that all players have equal and absolute access to all data and all source code of a dapp. If transparency is not absolute, the parties privy to insider knowledge would have an unfair advantage.

This principle is paramount in the blockchain infrastructure layer. All users must have access to the full source code of validator nodes. They must have full access to all blocks in the chain including all proofs that designate them as valid. Users should also be encouraged to run an audit node and see for themselves that execution of all transactions indeed yields the state presented to them.

All parts of a dapp must be open source. Its entire backend must be run as smart contracts on-chain, with published source that has been verified to compile the bytecode that was deployed. The frontend must be provided to users as a non-minified non-uglified version that they can easily run on their own.
