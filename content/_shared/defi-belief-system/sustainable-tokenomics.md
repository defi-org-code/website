Dapps are generally expected to have an incentives system revolving around a token. This incentives layer is what allows the actions of independent users of this decentralized system to converge around pre designed goals.

The market forces of all participants that deal in this token constitute an economy. This economy must be carefully designed to remain balanced over time. Since a decentralized system does not allow intervention, sustainability must be a property of the system itself.

An economy that is not sustainable will eventually spiral to its own death. Economies must be made resilient to adverse conditions and must be designed under the assumption that not all players have the systemâ€™s best interest at heart.
