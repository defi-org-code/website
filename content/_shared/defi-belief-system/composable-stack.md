To allow a DeFi ecosystem to reach its full potential, all participating protocols must see themselves as part of a protocol stack that is freely composable. Composition allows the output of one protocol to be directed into the input of another.

To permit composition, every dapp should be consumable by other dapps. Since all dapps are implemented as smart contracts, these should be designed to be callable from other smart contracts and thus cannot depend on centralized infrastructure not available on-chain.

Patterns of composition are not necessarily predictable. Protocols may be combined in ways that were not intended by their original creators to solve problems that were not originally anticipated.
