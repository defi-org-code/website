What is the true innovation behind crypto and blockchain? We believe the disruption is decentralization. The ability to build practical organizations that work towards a clear business goal, yet are not controlled by any centralized entity. Organizations that are both trustless and permissionless.

While this idea is applicable to many industries, it is primarily applicable to finance. Business goals are generally embodied in the generation of financial value, making the industry of financial services a first necessary target of this disruption. This explains our focus on DeFi.

Practical decentralization dictates a level playing field. It does not mean that everybody is equal, but all players in the ecosystem must have equal access and compete on equal grounds.
