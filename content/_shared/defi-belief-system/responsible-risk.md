In the domain of smart contracts, code is law. If a contract’s implementation allows it to be abused in a manner unforeseen by its creator and its users, this abuse is considered valid. Code does not have intent, nor subjective interpretation of its purpose.

Successful DeFi applications often contain significant amounts of user funds in their smart contracts. These funds are inherently at risk, since misunderstanding of the code may allow a third party to extract the funds against their rightful owners’ wishes.

Creators and users must collaborate continuously to minimize this risk. Code should be changed slowly and after thorough community review. Security audits are encouraged, yet their existence does not guarantee protection.
