Practical decentralization dictates a level playing field - this implies that any decision that changes the rules of the game and modifies the behavior of the protocol in any way, such as an upgrade of a dapp’s code, must undergo proper community governance.

Dapps are generally expected to have an incentives system revolving around a token. The governance power of a party should be proportional to the party’s holdings of this token. All parties should be allowed to participate in votes and no party can be censored.

Users should have complete and absolute access to all historic votes and resulting governance decisions. Users should also be encouraged to audit the voting process based on immutable chain data and see for themselves that the majority of stake has prevailed.
