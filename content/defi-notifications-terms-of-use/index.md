For the avoidance of doubt, any act or omission performed by you in connection with the App shall obligate your organization. 

2.  **The App and the Platform**

The App offers you access to information and push notifications regarding, *inter-alia*, real time data on activity regarding DeFi, blockchain and digital assets and major events occurring on-chain in Defi ecosystems such as accumulated pending rewards, price swings, near liquidations, stop loss, contract upgrades and new governance votes,

including any other content related thereto such as contact information, videos, text, files, logos, button icons, images, data compilations, links, other specialized content, technical data, documentation, know-how, specifications materials, designs, data, the "look and feel" of the App, algorithms, source and object code, interface, GUI, interactive features related graphics, illustrations, drawings, animations, and other features obtained from or through the App (collectively, the "**Content**").

These Terms of Use relate solely to the App and its use and not to any other platform or functionality provided by Hexa or on the DeFi.org website. 

For the avoidance of doubt, the App currently serves mainly as an informative tool, and, unless otherwise explicitly indicated in specific location within the App, engagements of any sort with us shall only be created on a first person basis (e.g. through a User's meeting or discussion with our representative). The Content does not bind Hexa in any form, and in any case where the Content contradicts or is inconsistent with separate agreements executed directly between Hexa and you, only information supplied by Hexa on a first person basis shall prevail. 

The Content provided through the App is provided for informational purposes only and does not constitute, and should not be construed as, financial, legal, investment, tax or any other advice. The information provided in the App has been prepared based upon information received from sources believed to be reliable, including data derived from public blockchain data, APIs and other related tools, but Hexa does not warrant its completeness or accuracy 

Hexa does not assume responsibility for any investment decisions. The data provided through the App is not intended as investment advice or an offer or solicitation for the purchase or sale of, or as an endorsement of, any blockchain token, cryptocurrency, security, financial instrument or other asset class, or any platform or service on which such assets are traded or otherwise utilized for any purpose. Hexa provides the App for research and discussion purposes only and does not provide general or individually tailored investment advice of any kind.

You must make your own independent decisions regarding any cryptocurrencies, blockchain tokens, asset classes, financial instruments or strategies mentioned or related to the Content provided through the App. Users should consult with their own advisors before making any investment or other financial decision. You ultimately must rely upon your own examination and that of your professional advisors, including legal counsel, financial advisors and accountants as to the legal, economic, tax, regulatory, or accounting treatment, suitability, and other aspects of the Content displayed on or provided through the App. Hexa shall not be liable for either (i) any errors or omissions made in the data or analyses contained on the App or (ii) damages (incidental, consequential or otherwise) which may arise from your or any other party's use of the data or analyses contained on the App.

***ALL RIGHTS IN AND TO THE CONTENT AVAILABLE ON THE APP ARE RESERVED TO HEXA OR ITS LICENSORS. TO THE EXTENT LEGALLY PERMISSIBLE, THE APP AND THE CONTENT AVAILABLE THEREIN ARE PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS.

***YOUR USE OF THE AND/OR THE CONTENT AVAILABLE THEREIN IS ENTIRELY AT YOUR OWN RISK.***

**Note**: Use of our App is currently free of charge. However, we reserve the right to charge fees for certain features available via our App in the future. You hereby acknowledge and agree that you may be charged for Internet, maintenance of network connection and data usage charges made through use of the App, according to the applicable rates charged by your respective third party Internet and data usage service provider as may be from time to time**.**

*Dependence on Third Party Applications and Parties*: The data provided on the App is derived from data stored on one or more blockchain networks on which the applicable DeFi project regarding which the User selects to receive notifications, including through third party tools or applications.  

These third party applications are not under the control of Hexa. Hexa does not own and does not control any DeFi platform or underlying blockchain networks or any other third-party products used for the function of the App or any other third-party site, product or service that you may choose to access, visit, or use for the purpose of interacting with or using the data on the App, such as a web browser. Accordingly, by using the App, you acknowledge that Hexa has no control over, and no duty to take any action regarding any data received from any blockchain network, DeFi platform, or any third party. Hexa will not be held liable, and are not liable, for the acts or omissions by any blockchain network, any DeFi platform or any other third party, nor are we liable, or will we be held liable, for any damage that you may suffer as a result of interacting with or using any of the mentioned or unmentioned third parties. 

You are solely responsible for the safety and security of your connection to the App. 

*Fees*. Hexa does not currently charge a fee for the App or data displayed therein. However, we reserve the right to do so in the future, and in such case shall display to you any applicable fees prior to you incurring the fee. 

*We are not responsible for any inaccuracy or loss*: The App, all digital assets and all underlying blockchain networks and DeFi platforms are still under active development and (a) may contain bugs, errors and defects, (b) may function improperly or be subject to periods of downtime and unavailability, (c) may result in total or partial loss or corruption of data or a delay or omission in receiving expected notifications; and (d) may be modified at any time, including through the release of subsequent versions, all with or without notice to you.
