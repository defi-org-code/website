DeFi.org is a community of thought leaders in the field of decentralized finance (DeFi). The community is led by the Orbs Network together with a consortium of market leaders in the blockchain and cryptocurrency industry to collaborate and advance the cause of DeFi innovation.

Together we **educate** - by teaching developers and users about practical decentralization, **invest** - by funding the projects we believe in so they can see the light of day, **accelerate** - by setting projects up for success and incubating when necessary, and build - by taking an active role in contributing to the ecosystem with our own hands.
