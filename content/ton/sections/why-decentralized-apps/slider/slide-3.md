title: Centralization reduces app value
---

Consider the most successful apps on blockchain: The [Bored Apes](https://boredapeyachtclub.com/) NFT collection has individual items sold for over a million dollars. The lending DeFi apps [Compound](https://compound.finance/) and [Aave](https://aave.com/) have tens of billions of dollars deposited in their smart contracts. How did these apps become so financially successful?

Users don’t know the founders of Bored Apes, Compound or Aave. Even if they did know them, they certainly wouldn’t trust them with a million dollars. Especially when they provide no legal obligation and there isn’t any form of signed legal contract involved.

Decentralization is the answer.

**Users are only able to deposit millions in these apps because they are trustless and even their founders don’t have access to funds. Without being decentralized, these apps wouldn’t be able to grow in value.**
