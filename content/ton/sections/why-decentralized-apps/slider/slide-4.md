title: Decentralized apps are unstoppable

Nobody can stop Bitcoin because it’s decentralized. There’s no single entity that is running it.

The same with decentralized apps. Even if you, the developer, go out of business or all of your servers are down, the app will live on and never stop.

If users deposit money in your app, they will always be safe and will never lose access to their funds because of your downtime.

**A decentralized app is not dependent on you for its execution. It has no servers that can go offline, just smart contracts. Running it is under the responsibility of the community, not yours.**
