title: Thatâ€™s the point of using blockchain

The designers of TON went into great lengths to make all core TON blockchain infrastructure services fully decentralized

- Anyone can run a validator and participate in PoS consensus without permission
- Anyone can acquire, transfer and stake TON coins without permission
- Anyone can access the chain directly without intermediaries without permission
- Anyone can write and deploy dapps as smart contracts without permission

**Making your app centralized will defy the point of using TON in the first place. There are far simpler infrastructure solutions that run centralized apps.**
