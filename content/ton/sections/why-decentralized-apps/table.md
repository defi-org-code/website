title: Centralization puts users at risk
---

TON apps will often deal with money. Users will deposit money in them and the apps are expected to be financially valuable in some way. Money equals responsibility.

Decentralized apps are trustless, meaning users are not required to trust their developers. The developers are not able to harm the users in any way even if they tried.

Users may get hurt even if you don’t intend to be malicious. If your credentials can cause damage, a hacker can compromise them and then users will get hurt. One of your employees can decide to steal and abuse their position. You don’t want to be responsible for these wrongdoings.

**Money equals responsibility. Decentralization shifts responsibility from you to your users. This is the trustless model that blockchain is based on.**
