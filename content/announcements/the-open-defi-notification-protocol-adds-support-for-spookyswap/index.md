[SpookySwap](https://spooky.fi/#/), the number 1 native DEX-AMM by TVL on the Fantom network, has integrated the Open DeFi Notifications Protocol to provide its users with free mobile notification for on-chain events.

SpookySwap users can now receive real-time notifications for their positions to better manage their trading strategies and risk.

The [Open DeFi Notification Protocol](https://defi.org/notifications/) App is now available on both [Apple AppStore](https://apps.apple.com/il/app/defi-notifications/id1588243632) and [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.orbs.openDefiNotificationsApp).

_The Open DeFi Notification Protocol by _[_defi.org_](https://defi.org/)_ is a free-for-use, community led initiative to provide users with decentralized and free mobile notifications for on-chain events. The Open DeFi Notification Protocol is powered by the _[_Orbs network_](https://www.orbs.com/)_ and will be executed by its decentralized network of independent nodes, known as the Orbs Guardians._

### Real-time Notifications For On-chain Events

The Open DeFi Notification provides users with free and dependable mobile notifications for on-chain events in order to optimize their DeFi trading strategies and help them manage their risk. The Notification app can be used to keep track of rewards when providing liquidity, set up stop-loss alerts, help avoid impermanent loss, and more.

There are currently two types of Notifications available for Spooky:

1.  Pending Reward: Get notified when your $BOO farming or staking rewards are above a specified threshold.
2.  Position Worth: Track your open positions total worth to take profit or to protect against losses.

All in all, the app supports 20 protocols across five networks: Ethereum, BSC, Polygon, Avalanche and Fantom!

About SpookySwap

[SpookySwap](https://www.spooky.fi/) is the top native decentralized exchange for the Fantom Opera network. Spooky has brought new capabilities to ETH-alternative networks such as being the first DEX to implement native limit orders outside of Ethereum and the first DEX to implement a bridge built into the interface. SpookySwap is fully decentralized with governance by BOO being used to determine all new farms, single-stake pools, and farm weight adjustments. Spooky's commitment to improving user experience and DeFi utility for Fantom resulted in a top protocol on Fantom Opera by both TVL and volume.
