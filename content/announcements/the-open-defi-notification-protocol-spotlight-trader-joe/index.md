[Trader Joe](https://traderjoexyz.com/home#/), the number 1 native DEX-AMM by TVL on the Avalanche network, has been integrated by the Open DeFi Notifications Protocol to provide its users with free mobile notification for on-chain events. In addition, Trader Joe has been a [launch partner](https://www.orbs.com/notifications-launch/) for the Notifications app release.

Trader Joe's users can now receive real-time notifications for their positions to better manage their trading strategies and risk.

The [Open DeFi Notification Protocol](https://defi.org/notifications/) App is now available on both [Apple AppStore](https://apps.apple.com/il/app/defi-notifications/id1588243632) and [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.orbs.openDefiNotificationsApp).

_The Open DeFi Notification Protocol by _[_defi.org_](https://defi.org/)_ is a free-for-use, community led initiative to provide users with decentralized and free mobile notifications for on-chain events. The Open DeFi Notification Protocol is powered by the _[_Orbs network_](https://www.orbs.com/)_ and will be executed by its decentralized network of independent nodes, known as the Orbs Guardians._

### Real-time Notifications For On-chain Events

The Open DeFi Notification provides users with free and dependable mobile notifications for on-chain events in order to optimize their DeFi trading strategies and help them manage their risk. The Notification app can be used to keep track of rewards when providing liquidity, set up stop-loss alerts, help avoid impermanent loss, and more.

**There are currently three types of Notifications available for Trader Joe:**

1.  Borrow Limit --- Account Health: Set up a custom threshold notification to monitor your [borrowing health](https://docs.traderjoexyz.com/en/trader-joe/lending/managing-your-portfolio) when engaging in lending/borrowing on Banker Joe.
2.  Position Worth: Get notified when your $JOE farming or staking rewards are above a specified threshold.
3.  Rocket Joe Launch: Get notified when a new [Rocket Joe](https://docs.traderjoexyz.com/en/trader-joe/rocket-joe) launch event has been created.
