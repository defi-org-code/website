#### The Open DeFi Notifications Protocol has integrated [Aave](https://aave.com/), the biggest crypto liquidity protocol, with over $11B in TVL!

Aave users can now sleep better knowing that their positions are monitored 24/7 and that they will receive real-time notifications to help them manage their risk.

The [Open DeFi Notification Protocol](https://defi.org/notifications/) App is available on both [Apple AppStore](https://apps.apple.com/il/app/defi-notifications/id1588243632) and [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.orbs.openDefiNotificationsApp).

_The Open DeFi Notification Protocol by _[_defi.org_](https://defi.org/)_ and powered by _[_Orbs_](https://www.orbs.com/)_ is a community led initiative to provide users with decentralized and free mobile notifications for on-chain events._

### The Best Way to Monitor Your Loaned Assets

Aave is the largest lending & borrowing protocol on the Ethereum network, available also on many other major chains, including: Polygon, Avalanche, Fantom, and more... Aave is a decentralized lending Protocol that allows users to lend, borrow and earn interest on crypto assets, for various activities and strategies across the DeFi space.

In order to borrow assets on Aave, borrowers must post collateral. Taking collateralized loans carries certain risks, primarily the risk of liquidation. Borrowers need to ensure that they do not cross their borrow limit, which can trigger the liquidation of their collateral.

As we all know, the crypto market is very volatile. Extreme price movements can decrease the notional value of a collateral's token or increase the value of the borrowed currency (or both), increasing the risk of liquidation. At times such as these, borrowers can experience some sleepless nights, having to regularly monitor their position status.

Well, not anymore!

Using the Open DeFi Notification Protocol, Aave users can set up a "Position Health" notification which will issue an alert when your position gets close to liquidation. In this way, users have 24/7 monitoring of their position status, and can take immediate action in order to mitigate the risk of liquidation.

### A Notification Standard for Leading DeFi Projects

The Open DeFi Notification Protocol is an open initiative to provide users with decentralized and free mobile notifications for on-chain events.

Aave joins other top DeFi lending protocols, such as [Venus](https://medium.com/@defiorg/the-open-defi-notification-protocol-now-supports-venus-protocol-c1d1e7ada0eb) and [Alpaca Finance](https://medium.com/@defiorg/the-open-defi-notification-protocol-now-supports-alpaca-finance-c99213c5f72d), supported by the Open DeFi Notification app, with liquidation risk notifications being one of the most popular use-case by the app users.

The addition of Aave makes for an impressive lineup of leading DeFi projects who have already been integrated into the Open DeFi Notification app for the benefit of their users, including among others: Aave, Uniswap, SushiSwap, QuickSwap, PancakeSwap and more...

All in all, the app supports 20 protocols across 5 networks: Ethereum, BSC, Polygon, Fantom and Avalanche!

The Open DeFi Notification Protocol is an open-source project allowing anyone to contribute and integrate notifications. With a quick and simple integration on Github, developers can provide free mobile notifications for any DeFi project for important events like accumulated pending rewards, price swings, near liquidations, stop loss, contract upgrades, new governance votes and more.

For more info and developers resources see [here](https://medium.com/@defiorg/defi-org-dappradar-launch-100k-developers-grant-for-the-open-defi-notification-protocol-c584afacea62)

The Protocol has been implemented fully by the [Orbs network](https://www.orbs.com/) and will be executed by the Orbs Guardians, making this the 1st fully decentralized implementation of a notification protocol.
