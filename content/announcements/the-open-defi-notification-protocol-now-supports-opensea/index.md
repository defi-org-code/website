The Open DeFi Notifications Protocol has integrated [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/), the leading NFTs marketplace, to provide its users with free mobile notification for on-chain events.

OpenSea users can now receive real-time notifications from OpenSea to better manage their portfolio and keep track of the fast-moving NFT market!

The [Open DeFi Notification Protocol](https://defi.org/notifications/) App is available on both [Apple AppStore](https://apps.apple.com/il/app/defi-notifications/id1588243632) and [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.orbs.openDefiNotificationsApp).

_The Open DeFi Notification Protocol by _[_defi.org_](https://defi.org/)_ is a free-for-use, community led initiative to provide users with decentralized and free mobile notifications for on-chain events. The Open DeFi Notification Protocol is powered by the _[_Orbs network_](https://www.orbs.com/)_ and will be executed by its decentralized network of independent nodes, known as the Orbs Guardians._

### Floor Price is Up? Be the First to Know!

OpenSea is the world's first and largest digital marketplace for crypto collectibles and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).

The Open DeFi Notification Protocol provides users with free and dependable mobile notifications for on-chain events in order to optimize their DeFi and NFTs investments. There are currently three types of Notifications available for OpenSea:

1.  **Floor Price:** Get notified when the floor price of a collection is above or below a certain threshold.
2.  **New Offers:** Get notified about new offers for your NFTs.
3.  **New Offers with Floor:** Get notified about new offers for your NFTs above a specified floor price.

**All in all, the app supports 20 protocols across 5 networks: Ethereum, BSC, Polygon, Fantom and Avalanche!**
