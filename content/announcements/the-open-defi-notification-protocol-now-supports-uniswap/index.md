Uniswap is the leading decentralized crypto protocol for trading and automated liquidity provision on Ethereum.

Uniswap users can now benefit from real-time notifications for their positions to better manage their trading strategies and risk.

The [Open DeFi Notification Protocol](https://defi.org/notifications/) app is available on both [Apple AppStore](https://apps.apple.com/il/app/defi-notifications/id1588243632) and [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.orbs.openDefiNotificationsApp).

_The Open DeFi Notification Protocol by _[_defi.org_](https://defi.org/)_ is a free-for-use, community-inspired initiative to provide users with decentralized and free mobile notifications for all sorts of on-chain events. The Protocol is powered by the Orbs network and will be executed by its decentralized network of independent nodes, known as the Orbs Guardians._

### DeFi Notifications --- Control Your Trading Positions 24/7

Uniswap is one of the earliest projects to implement DEX-AMM protocols, and was instrumental in setting off the explosion of DeFi in 2020. It is still one of the most popular and widely used DEX-AMMs with over $7B in TVL and ~$2B in daily trading volume.

However, having such an impressive array of assets to trade, it can be complicated to keep track of your positions.

This is where the Notification app steps in -

By using the app, Uniswap users can optimize their DeFi trading strategies and better manage risk, using free and dependable DeFi notifications for on-chain events. The Notification app can be used to keep track of rewards when providing liquidity, monitor price swings, set up stop-loss alerts, help avoid impermanent loss, and in later stages also be notified of contract upgrades, new governance votes and more.

There is currently the following type of Notifications available for Uniswap users, with more notification options coming up soon:

- Position Worth: Track your staked position's total worth to protect against loss.

### Top-Tier DeFi Projects Already Support the DeFi Notification App

The Open DeFi Notification Protocol powered by Orbs is an open initiative to provide users with free, instant and decentralized mobile notifications for crucial on-chain events.

Uniswap has joined an impressive lineup of leading DeFi projects who have already integrated the Notification app for the benefit of their users. Platforms using The Open DeFi Notification Protocol include, among others, [Quickswap](https://quickswap.exchange/#/swap), [Trader Joe](https://traderjoexyz.com/home#/home) and [PancakeSwap](https://pancakeswap.finance/) --- the largest DEX-AMMs on Polygon, Avalanche and BSC respectively, as well as [Alpaca Finance](https://app.alpacafinance.org/farm), the biggest lending platform on BSC.

All in all, the app supports 20 protocols across five networks: Ethereum, BNB Smart Chain, Polygon, Fantom and Avalanche! Take a look at some of them:
