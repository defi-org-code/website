[SpiritSwap](https://www.spiritswap.finance/), one of the leading DEX-AMMs on the Fantom network, has integrated the Open DeFi Notifications Protocol to provide its users with free mobile notification for on-chain events.

SpiritSwap users can now receive real-time notifications for their positions to better manage their trading strategies and risk.

The [Open DeFi Notification Protocol](https://defi.org/notifications/) App is now available on both [Apple AppStore](https://apps.apple.com/il/app/defi-notifications/id1588243632) and [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.orbs.openDefiNotificationsApp).

_The Open DeFi Notification Protocol by _[_defi.org_](https://defi.org/)_ is a free-for-use, community led initiative to provide users with decentralized and free mobile notifications for on-chain events. The Open DeFi Notification Protocol is powered by the _[_Orbs network_](https://www.orbs.com/)_ and will be executed by its decentralized network of independent nodes, known as the Orbs Guardians._

### Real-time Notifications For On-chain Events

SpiritSwap is at the forefront of DeFi innovation, having recently introduced their own version of vote-locked token called [inSPIRIT](https://docs.spiritswap.finance/spirit-swap/inspirit), as well as leveraged trading using their Ape Mode feature.

The Open DeFi Notification provides users with free and dependable mobile notifications for on-chain events in order to optimize their DeFi trading strategies and help them manage their risk. The Notification app can be used to keep track of rewards when providing liquidity, set up stop-loss alerts, help avoid impermanent loss, and more.

Using the Notification app, SpiritSwap users can now set up a Pending Reward notification, which enables them to get notified when their $SPIRIT farming rewards are above a specified threshold. The Pending Reward notification supports both the V1 standard Masterchef contract and V2 gauge emissions contract.

More notification types to come soon... stay tuned!

All in all, the app supports 20 protocols across four networks: Ethereum, BSC, Polygon and Avalanche!
