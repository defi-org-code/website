[PancakeSwap](https://pancakeswap.finance/), the dominant DEX on BNB Smart Chain (BSC), is now supported by the Open DeFi Notifications Protocol to provide its users with free mobile notifications for on-chain events.

PancakeSwap users can now take advantage of real-time notifications for their positions to better manage their trading strategies and risk.

The [Open DeFi Notification Protocol](https://defi.org/notifications/) app is available on both [Apple AppStore](https://apps.apple.com/il/app/defi-notifications/id1588243632) and [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.orbs.openDefiNotificationsApp).

_The Open DeFi Notification Protocol by _[_defi.org_](https://defi.org/)_ is a free-for-use, community-inspired initiative to provide users with decentralized and free mobile notifications for all sorts of on-chain events. The Protocol is powered by the _[_Orbs network_](https://www.orbs.com/)_ and will be executed by its decentralized network of independent nodes, known as the Orbs Guardians._

### DeFi Notifications --- Be One Step Ahead of the Market Curve

PancakeSwap is one of the most popular DEXs on BNB Smart Chain, with over $4.63B in TVL, 3.6M users, $12 billion staked fundsand support for almost any token on BSC.

However, having such an impressive array of features and assets to trade, it can be hard to keep track of your positions.

This is where the Notification app steps in -

By using the app, PancakeSwap users can optimize their DeFi trading strategies and better manage risk, using free and dependable DeFi notifications for on-chain events. The Notification app can be used to keep track of rewards when providing liquidity, monitor price swings, set up stop-loss alerts, help avoid impermanent loss, and in later stages also be notified of contract upgrades, new governance votes and more.

There are currently two types of Notifications available for PancakeSwap users:

1.  Pending Reward (Farms): Get notified when enough farming rewards are ready to be claimed.
2.  Pending Reward (Syrup Pools): Get notified when enough reward on a Syrup Pool is ready to be claimed.
3.  Tokens Worth: Track your tokens total value.
4.  Position Worth: Track your staked position's total worth to protect against loss
