[DeFi.org](https://defi.org/) is excited to announce the release of MyNFT.fyi --- a tool for PfP (profile picture) NFT verification!

As Twitter is still trying to wrap their heads around how to do a [PfP NFT verification](https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22689806/twitter-bitcoin-lightning-tipping-nft-authentication), we at DeFi.org already have a working solution, free of charge, for the benefit of the crypto community -

MyNFT.fyi is an easy-to-use tool for showcasing your NFT profile image with a complete on-chain proof of ownership.

Check it out [Here](https://mynft.fyi/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=defiorg).

### A Simple On-chain Verification Process

With PfP NFTs fast becoming the new Twitter blue check-mark for CT (Crypto Twitter), we can already see the imminent surge of impostors, impersonators, scam accounts, bots or just trolls, trying to use this latest craze as an attack vector.

Up until now, proving NFT ownership was a time-consuming, cumbersome task.

Well, not anymore: Where there's a need --- there's DeFi.org!

We just couldn't pass on this excellent opportunity to showcase our abilities, and together with the experts from the [Orbs](https://www.orbs.com/) team we came up with this elegant, yet simple, solution: MyNFT.fyi!

In a few simple steps, MyNFT.fyi allows you to quickly verify ownership of your NFT profile image (or any other NFT) by entering your Opensea NFT URL and signing off with your Ethereum address. Once done you will be able to share your certificate for all of CT to see!

That is exactly why we at DeFi.org decided to undertake this challenge and create MyNFT.fyi.
