[Orbs](https://www.orbs.com/) is a public blockchain infrastructure operating as an independent execution layer enhancing the capabilities of EVM based smart contracts. Orbs is also a managing partner of the [DeFi.org](https://defi.org/) accelerator.

Orbs recently [announced](https://www.orbs.com/polygon-staking/) its novel PoS V3: Multi-chain staking, enabling Orbs Delegators to stake their ORBS tokens on Ethereum and Polygon in the Orbs proof-of-stake mechanism. As part of this major protocol upgrade, Orbs has also integrated the Open DeFi Notification Protocol so that Orbs stakers can now set-up free, real-time notifications on their staking positions.

The [Open DeFi Notification Protocol](https://defi.org/notifications/) app is available on both [Apple AppStore](https://apps.apple.com/il/app/defi-notifications/id1588243632) and [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.orbs.openDefiNotificationsApp).

_The Open DeFi Notification Protocol by _[_defi.org_](https://defi.org/)_ is a free-for-use, community-inspired initiative to provide users with decentralized and free mobile notifications for all sorts of on-chain events. The Protocol is powered by the _[_Orbs network_](https://www.orbs.com/)_ and will be executed by its decentralized network of independent nodes, known as the Orbs Guardians._

**Introducing Orbs Staking Notifications**

The Orbs network is the first protocol to implement PoS staking notifications, adding a new use-case to the growing arsenal of existing notifications, which include among others notifications for DEX-AMMs such as [PancakeSwap ](https://medium.com/@defiorg/the-open-defi-notification-protocol-now-supports-pancakeswap-dex-b13cdac9e2d1)and [SushiSwap](https://medium.com/@defiorg/the-open-defi-notification-protocol-now-supports-alpaca-finance-c99213c5f72d), and lending protocols such as [Alpaca Finance](https://medium.com/@defiorg/the-open-defi-notification-protocol-now-supports-alpaca-finance-c99213c5f72d).

Using the Open DeFi Notification Protocol, Orbs stakers are now able to set up free, real-time notifications to track their staking on both the Ethereum and Polygon chains.

Currently, there are 2 types of notifications available for Orbs stakers:

1.  **Pending Reward:** Get notified when your pending ORBS rewards are above a specified amount.
2.  **Unlock Cooldown:** Get notified when the 14 days cooldown period for your claimed ORBS tokens is over.

To make things even easier, Orbs stakers can set up notifications directly from [Tetra](https://staking.orbs.network/), the official staking wallet by the Orbs team, using the new DeFi Notifications Widget!

**L3 Applications Powered by Orbs**

Orbs was the first to fully implement the Open DeFi Notification Protocol by [defi.org](https://defi.org/), utilizing its unique hybrid architecture and [Layer 3](https://www.orbs.com/How-Orbs-Hybrid-Architecture-Is-Becoming-a-Game-Changer-in-DeFi/) properties. Orbs has also been a key contributor to the project development.

Right from the launch, an impressive lineup of leading DeFi projects integrated the Notification app for the benefit of their users. Partners of The Open DeFi Notification Protocol include, among others, [Quickswap](https://quickswap.exchange/#/swap), [Trader Joe](https://traderjoexyz.com/home#/home) and PancakeSwap --- the largest DEX-AMMs on Polygon, Avalanche and BSC respectively, as well as [Alpaca Finance](https://app.alpacafinance.org/farm), the biggest lending platform on BSC.

All in all, the app supports 20 protocols across five networks: Ethereum, BNB Smart Chain, Polygon, Fantom and Avalanche! Take a look at some of them:

The Open DeFi Notification Protocol has been implemented fully by the [Orbs network](https://www.orbs.com/) and will be executed by the Orbs Guardians, making this the first fully decentralized implementation of a notification protocol.
