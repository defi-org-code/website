Polygon, the leading platform for Ethereum scaling and infrastructure development., DeFi.org, a community-led defi accelerator and Orbs, the Layer 3 blockchain infrastructure project, are thrilled to announce the launch of a new defi accelerator program!

This special round of the DeFi.org accelerator will focus on building defi applications that utilize Polygon's L2 capabilities and Orbs' [L3 infrastructure](https://www.orbs.com/How-Orbs-Hybrid-Architecture-Is-Becoming-a-Game-Changer-in-DeFi/). Participants will get a variety of benefits, including mentorship, funding opportunities, and market exposure.

DeFi.org is excited about working together with Orbs and Polygon in helping founders to launch the next wave of defi innovation.

### Focus on Layer 2 + 3 DeFi Applications

This special accelerator round offers a unique opportunity for developers to utilize the Ethereum stack to its fullest potential:

Participants in this round will be required to build on the Polygon ecosystem. Polygon is the leading Ethereum scaling platform where developers are enabled to build scalable and secure dApps while having affordable transaction fees.

In addition, special consideration will be given to proposals utilizing Orbs' L3 infrastructure. The Orbs public blockchain infrastructure, powered by its Guardians, a public network of permissionless validators, provides a separate [L3 execution layer](https://www.orbs.com/How-Orbs-Hybrid-Architecture-Is-Becoming-a-Game-Changer-in-DeFi/) that operates in conjunction with EVM-based L1s and L2s, for enriching the capabilities of EVM smart contract.

The combination of L2 on Polygon and L3 on the Orbs network presents a unique opportunity for new and innovative defi applications, and we're excited to see what the community can come up with!
