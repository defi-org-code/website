ðŸ“¢ðŸ“¢ CALLING ALL DEVELOPERS!!

[DeFi.orgÂ ](https://defi.org/)is excited to launch a new $100,000 developer grant program, in collaboration withÂ [DappRadar](https://dappradar.com/), for TheÂ [Open DeFi Notification Protocol](https://defi.org/notifications/).

The Open DeFi Notification Protocol byÂ [defi.org](https://defi.org/)Â is a free-for-use, community-inspired initiative to provide users with decentralized and free mobile notifications for all sorts of on-chain events. The Protocol is powered by theÂ [Orbs network](https://www.orbs.com/)Â and will be executed by its decentralized network of independent nodes, known as the Orbs Guardians.

### $100,000 Developer Grant Program!

This grant will focus on teams contributing new projects to the Notification protocol!

The Open DeFi Notification Protocol is an open-source project allowing anyone to contribute and integrate notifications. With a quick and simple integration on Github, developers can provide free mobile notifications for any DeFi project for important events like accumulated pending rewards, price swings, near liquidations, stop loss, contract upgrades, new governance votes and more.

Grant details:

- Start date: 30/05/22
- End date: 30/09/22
- Duration: 4 months
- Grants: Available total of up to $100,000, with up to $10k per dev team

Winners and final grant amounts will be chosen by a committee of the defi.org mentors who will score entries based on the following parameters:

1.  Project contributions:Â team must contribute at least 1 project to be eligible for receiving the grant. However, more contributions will earn more points from the judges.
2.  Active notifications:Â The more active notifications for your project contributions, the better!
3.  Innovation:Â Teams are encouraged to make use of the existing projects and use-cases found in thisÂ [repo](https://github.com/open-defi-notification-protocol/projects). However, new and innovative use cases and integrations will earn extra points.
4.  Social media presence:Â At least one tweet announcing your contribution tagging @orbs_network, @DappRadar, and @DefiOrg. However, additional social media activities such as educational blog posts, tutorial videos, etc., will get extra consideration from the judges.

Once ready, dev teams need to submit their entry in thisÂ [FORM](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScWXOXHC0MkUiDwclLVw82gWzx60TAu5cORGAqYM0sKLLGjxg/viewform?usp=pp_url).

A DeFi.org mentors committee will select winners, in their sole discretion, based on the criteria above.

**So what are you waiting for?!**

**Join us to earn up to $100,000 in developers grants!**

### Developer Resources

The best place to start is The Open DeFi Notification ProtocolÂ [Github](https://github.com/open-defi-notification-protocol), specifically thisÂ [README](https://github.com/open-defi-notification-protocol/projects/blob/master/README.md)Â file.

As mentioned above, anyone can contribute to the protocol. All this requires is implementing a simple JavaScript web3 class that extracts the notification from the chain data.

This class is then contributed via PR to the protocolÂ [Github repo](https://github.com/open-defi-notification-protocol/projects). The whole process takes about 30 minutes for someone familiar with the project's smart contracts. There's no need to run any backend, develop any UI or make any modification to the project's smart contracts.

When a new user registers for this notification in the app (available on bothÂ [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/il/app/defi-notifications/id1588243632)Â andÂ [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.orbs.openDefiNotificationsApp)), the protocol's many alert nodes will start executing the newly contributed JavaScript web3 class against every new mainnet block to extract fresh notifications. When any fresh notification is returned, the alert nodes will trigger a push notification and send it to the user.

Once the PR is accepted, the project will immediately appear inside the mobile app with this new notification type enabled. You can control the project label, logo and colors by adding a small JSON file next to the class.
