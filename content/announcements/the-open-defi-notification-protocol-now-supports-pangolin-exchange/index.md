Pangolin, one of the leading DEX-AMMs on the Avalanche network, has integrated the Open DeFi Notifications Protocol to provide its users with free mobile notification for on-chain events.

Pangolin users can now receive real-time notifications for their positions to better manage their trading strategies and risk.

The [Open DeFi Notification Protocol](https://defi.org/notifications/) App is now available on both [Apple AppStore](https://apps.apple.com/il/app/defi-notifications/id1588243632) and [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.orbs.openDefiNotificationsApp).

_The Open DeFi Notification Protocol by _[_defi.org_](https://defi.org/)_ is a free-for-use, community-led initiative to provide users with decentralized and free mobile notifications for on-chain events. The Open DeFi Notification Protocol is powered by the _[_Orbs network_](https://www.orbs.com/)_ and will be executed by its decentralized network of independent nodes, known as the Orbs Guardians._

### Notifications --- Step Up Your DeFi Game

Pangolin is one of the leading DEX-AMMs on Avalanche, with over $215M in TVL. Pangolin also recently [announced](https://twitter.com/pangolindex/status/1493602233597972490) that they are going multi-chain, following integration with Near Protocol.

The Open DeFi Notification provides users with free and dependable mobile notifications for on-chain events in order to optimize their DeFi trading strategies and help them manage their risk. The Notification app can be used to keep track of rewards when providing liquidity, set up stop-loss alerts, help avoid impermanent loss, and more.

There are currently two types of Notifications available for Pangolin:

1.  Pending Reward: Get notified when your PNG farming or staking rewards are above a specified threshold.
2.  Position Worth: Track your open positions' total worth to take profit or to protect against losses.

Launch partners of The Open DeFi Notification Protocol include, among others, Quickswap and Trader Joe --- the largest DEX-AMMs on Polygon on Avalanche respectively.

All in all, the app supports 20 protocols across four networks: Ethereum, BSC, Polygon, and Avalanche!
