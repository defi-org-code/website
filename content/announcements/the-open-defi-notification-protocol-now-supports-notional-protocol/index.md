The Open DeFi Notifications Protocol has integrated [Notional](https://notional.finance/), one of the leading lending protocols on Ethereum with over $100M in TVL.

Notional users can now sleep better knowing that their positions are monitored 24/7 and that they will receive real-time notifications to help them manage their risk.

The [Open DeFi Notification Protocol](https://defi.org/notifications/) App is available on both [Apple AppStore](https://apps.apple.com/il/app/defi-notifications/id1588243632) and [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.orbs.openDefiNotificationsApp).

_The Open DeFi Notification Protocol by _[_defi.org_](https://defi.org/)_ is a community led initiative to provide users with decentralized and free mobile notifications for on-chain events._

The Best Way to Monitor Your Loaned Assets

Notional is a protocol on Ethereum that facilitates fixed-rate, fixed-term crypto asset lending and borrowing.

Notional users can [borrow assets](https://docs.notional.finance/notional-v2/notional-v2-basics/borrowing) on the platform at a fixed rate by posting collateral such as ETH. The interest rate will depend on the chosen loan maturity date. As the loan approaches maturity, the borrower can either repay the loan or roll it forward to a future maturity. If the borrower doesn't repay the loan or roll it forward prior to maturity he faces the risk of being [liquidated](https://docs.notional.finance/notional-v2/risk-and-collateralization/liquidation).

Using the Open DeFi Notification Protocol, Notional users can set up a "Debt Settlement" notification which will issue an alert when your borrowed assets are close to maturity. In this way, users have 24/7 monitoring of their position status, and can take the necessary actions to manage their open loans and avoid liquidation.

A Notification Standard for Leading DeFi Projects

The Open DeFi Notification Protocol is an open initiative to provide users with decentralized and free mobile notifications for on-chain events.

Notional joins other top DeFi lending protocols, such as [Aave](https://medium.com/@defiorg/the-open-defi-notification-protocol-now-supports-aave-c544bdb89ce), [Venus](https://medium.com/@defiorg/the-open-defi-notification-protocol-now-supports-venus-protocol-c1d1e7ada0eb) and [Alpaca Finance](https://medium.com/@defiorg/the-open-defi-notification-protocol-now-supports-alpaca-finance-c99213c5f72d), supported by the Open DeFi Notification app, with liquidation risk notifications being one of the most popular use-case by the app users.

The addition of Notional makes for an impressive lineup of leading DeFi projects who have already been integrated into the Open DeFi Notification app for the benefit of their users, including among others: Aave, Uniswap, SushiSwap, QuickSwap, PancakeSwap and more...

All in all, the app supports 20 protocols across 5 networks: Ethereum, BSC, Polygon, Fantom and Avalanche!

The Open DeFi Notification Protocol is an open-source project allowing anyone to contribute and integrate notifications. With a quick and simple integration on Github, developers can provide free mobile notifications for any DeFi project for important events like accumulated pending rewards, price swings, near liquidations, stop loss, contract upgrades, new governance votes and more.

For more info and developers resources see [here](https://medium.com/@defiorg/defi-org-dappradar-launch-100k-developers-grant-for-the-open-defi-notification-protocol-c584afacea62).
