### Decentralized alert nodes

Notification schemas are constantly executed by protocol alert nodes in order to analyze new blocks of on-chain data for notifying protocol subscribers. Alert nodes are currently supported on [Orbs Network](https://www.orbs.com/), a permissionless PoS blockchain, and executed by the public validators of the network.
