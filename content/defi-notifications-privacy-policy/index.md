## DeFi Notifications Privacy Policy

### Last Revised: October 12, 2021

Hexa Foundation Ltd. (CC) and its affiliates ("**Hexa**", "**we**" or "**us**") respect the privacy of users of our DeFi Notifications application (the "**App**") and related services ("**User**" or "**you**") and are committed to protect the personal information that their Users share with us. We believe that you have a right to know our practices regarding the information we may collect, receive and use when you visit and/or use the App.

Capitalized terms which are not defined herein, shall have the meaning ascribed to them in our Terms of Use at [Terms of Use](/defi-notifications-terms-of-use) ("**TOU**"), into which this Privacy Policy is incorporated by reference.

This Privacy Policy and the ToU into which this Privacy Policy is incorporated relate solely to the App and its use. Use of any other platform or website provided by Hexa is subject to the applicable terms of service of such platform or website.

1.  **Your Consent (PLEASE READ CAREFULLY!)**

BY ENTERING, CONNECTING TO, ACCESSING OR USING THE APP, YOU AGREE TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS SET FORTH IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY (THE "**PRIVACY POLICY**"), INCLUDING TO THE COLLECTION AND PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION (AS DEFINED BELOW). IF YOU DISAGREE TO ANY TERM PROVIDED HEREIN, YOU MAY NOT ACCESS OR USE THE APP.

FOR AVOIDANCE OF DOUBT, YOU HEREBY CONSENT TO THE COLLECTION, PROCESSING, TRANSFER AND USE OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION. YOU ALSO ACKNOWLEDGE AND CONFIRM THAT YOU ARE NOT REQUIRED TO PROVIDE US WITH YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION AND THAT SUCH INFORMATION IS _VOLUNTARILY_ PROVIDED TO US.

2.  **Which information we may collect on our Users?**

We may collect two types of data and information from our Users:

a. Non-identifiable and anonymous information ("**Non-personal Information**"). **We are not aware of the identity of the User from whom we have collected the Non-personal Information.** Non-Personal Information is any unconcealed information which does not enable identification of an individual User, and which is available to us while such User is entering into and/or using the App. Non-personal Information which is being gathered consists of technical information, behavioral information and aggregated information, and may contain, among other things, the activity of the User on the App (including , type of operating system, User's preferences 'click-stream' or searches on the App, type and version of browser, keyboard language, screen resolution, etc.

<div class="padding"></div>

b. Personally identifiable information ("**Personal Information**"). **This information may identify an individual or may be of a private and/or sensitive nature**. We do not currently plan on collecting or storing any of your Personal Information through the use of the App. Our third party analytics services may collect the User's IP address primarily for enhancing the User's experience and for geo-location and security purposes as further detailed below.

Personal Information may be gathered if any personal details are provided consciously and voluntarily by the User in any contact made with us, including through any contact form which may be available through the App, which may include, _inter alia_, the User's name, country, company/organization name, the User's position in the company/organization, his/her e-mail address and telephone number. Once your contact details are received by us, our representatives may contact you for further communication. Our representative may collect additional Personal Information from you in the course of such communications.

The functionality of the App does, however, require you to provide a blockchain wallet address that is utilized to generate your list of potential push notifications. You may use your own wallet address or a wallet address that is not owned by you. This wallet address will be collected and stored by us and associated with your push notification preferences. If you do utilize your own wallet address, this will be collected and stored on the App together with your notification preferences.

For avoidance of doubt, any Non-Personal Information connected or linked to any Personal Information shall be deemed as Personal Information as long as such connection or linkage exists.

**We do not collect any Personal Information from you or related to you without your approval, which is obtained, _inter alia_, through your active acceptance to the TOU and the Privacy Policy.**

3.  **How Do We Collect Information on Our Users?**

There are a few methods that we use:

a. **We collect information through your entry and use of the** App. In other words, when you are using the App we are aware of it and may gather, collect and store the information relating to such usage.
