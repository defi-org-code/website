SushiSwap users can now benefit from using the real-time notifications for their positions to better manage their trading strategies and minimize potential risk.

You can easily get the Open DeFi Notification Protocol either on Apple AppStore or on Google Play.
The Open DeFi Notification Protocol by defi.org is a free-for-use, community-driven initiative to grant users decentralized and free mobile notifications for all sorts of on-chain events. The Protocol is powered by the Orbs network and will be executed by its decentralized network of independent nodes, known as the Orbs Guardians.
DeFi Notifications — Keep Your Positions Under Control

SushiSwap is a fully decentralized on-chain protocol for exchanging tokens through a process of automated market-making (AMM) which uses the system of ‘liquidity pools’. SushiSwap has $3.99B in TVL, $2B Total Liquidity and $172.3B in Total Value, while supporting 14 chains.
However, while having such an impressive array of features and liquidity pools, it can be hard to keep track of your positions.
This is where the Notification app steps in the game -
By using the app, SushiSwap users can optimize their DeFi trading strategies and better manage risk, using free and dependable DeFi notifications for on-chain events. The Notification app can be used to keep track of rewards when providing liquidity, monitor price swings, set up stop-loss alerts, help avoid impermanent loss, and in later stages also be notified of contract upgrades, new governance votes and more.
There are currently two types of Notifications available for SushiSwap users:
Pending Reward: get notified when enough reward is ready to claim
Position Worth: track your staked position’s total worth to protect against loss



Top-Tier DeFi Projects Already Support the DeFi Notification App
The Open DeFi Notification Protocol powered by Orbs is an open initiative to provide users with free, instant and decentralized mobile notifications for crucial on-chain events.
SushiSwap has joined an impressive lineup of leading DeFi projects who have already integrated the Notification app for the benefit of their users. Partners of The Open DeFi Notification Protocol include, among others, Quickswap and Trader Joe — the largest DEX-AMMs on Polygon on Avalanche respectively, as well as Alpaca Finance, the biggest lending platform on BNB Chain.
All in all, the app supports 20 protocols across four networks: Ethereum, BSC, Polygon, and Avalanche!

The Protocol has been implemented fully by the Orbs network and will be executed by the Orbs Guardians, making this the 1st fully decentralized implementation of a notification protocol.
